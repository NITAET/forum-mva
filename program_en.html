President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky leaves the hall accompanied by Acting Minister of Veterans Affairs of Ukraine Oleksandr Porkhun to visit the exhibition area presented on the 3rd floor, namely:<br/><br/>

A model of a real veteran space and a VR version of the space currently open and operating in the Mykolaiv region. 
Several specialists will work at the location. At the reception, there will be two real specialists who will consult each attendee during the event on issues related to veteran policy: from obtaining statuses to starting their own business. The location will also feature a qualified psychologist, a lawyer, a representative of Veteran Development Centers (consultations on education and retraining for veterans), and a business consultant on grants from the Ukrainian Veterans Foundation of the Ministry of Veterans Affairs.
The veteran space will include a children’s leisure area for the children of Ukraine’s defenders.<br/><br/>

Veteran Businesses:<br/><br/>

Strigg Drones: Founded by Vyacheslav Strazhets, who defended Ukraine in the Avdiivka direction in 2022, where he sustained a serious injury. Since August 2023, he has established the production of FPV drones. In October 2024, he received a grant to develop his own business from the UVF under the “Varto: Golden Hands” program. The enterprise is currently developing and actively producing various types and sizes of FPV drones.
<br/>

TM “Vyshyvanochka”: A family veteran business founded by veteran Oleksandr Tkachuk in May 2022. In January 2023, it opened its own production (the first embroidery equipment was purchased within the framework of the “Varto 2.0” project by UVF). Currently, Vyshyvanochka is a small enterprise with 15 employees, its own offline store in Lviv, and representations in Spain (Alanya) and Canada (Toronto). In addition to ethnic clothing, they also produce UAVs.

<br/><br/>
Photo Exhibition “Life”<br/><br/>

The “Life” photo exhibition consists of two parts and is dedicated to the female experience of war.
<br/><br/>
●	Participants: veterans and women in military service. Each shared their experience of why they chose to defend their country. <br/>
●	Mothers, wives, and children of fallen heroes tell viewers about why their loved ones chose to defend their country. This poignant exhibition combines valor and sorrow, joy and grief. The photo exhibition aims to demonstrate the experience of women whose lives have been irrevocably affected by the war. Despite losses, traumas, and pain, they live, fight, give birth to children, overcome challenges, and carry the memory of those who died for each of us.

<br/><br/>
National Military Memorial Cemetery<br/><br/>

The main Military Memorial site of the country will introduce participants to the meanings and symbolism of the National Military Memorial Cemetery (NMMC). The location will feature a model of the burial sector at the National Military Memorial Cemetery and the identity of the NMMC. A white wall will also be installed where anyone can attach the name of a close person, a brother, or a sister who died fighting for their country. This improvised memorial in memory of the defenders will be preserved and transferred to the future Museum Complex at the NMMC.
